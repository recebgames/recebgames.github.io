	<h1>TERMS OF SERVICE</h1>
	<h2>GAME</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Any information or data you submit to Chicken Invaders Universe or any of the Chicken Invaders Episodes (the "Game") and which will be visible by other players must not be offensive, religious, sexual, discriminatory, or otherwise inappropriate for the Game's age rating (namely, 7+).</li>
		<li>Any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) you submit to the Game must:
			<ul>
				<li>be truthful and accurate</li>
				<li>belong to you personally</li>
				<li>be kept up-to-date whenever it changes</li>
			</ul>
		<li>Each Game account you create is required to be associated with legitimate e-mail address that belongs to you and which you regularly use. Additionally, you may maintain at most one (1) guest account.</li>
		<li>You may not share your Game account or your login information with anyone. You may not log in using Game accounts that do not  belong to you personally.</li>
		<li>You may not purchase, sell, gift or trade any Game account.</li>
		<li>You may not advertise or promote any product or service within the Game.</li>
		<li>You may not play the Game in such a way that it is abusive or otherwise detrimental to other players' experience of the Game ("griefing").</li>
		<li>In any case where resources are allocated to you from a limited pool, you must adhere to the per-player limits associated with each resource. You may not abuse resources allocated to you, or hamper, prevent, or deprive other players from access to same resources.</li>
		<li>You may not modify any of the Game's files in any way that affects the Game's core rules and mechanics, or that provides you with an unfair advantage against players using unmodified files.</li>
		<li>You may not use external tools or processes to:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>monitor, modify, or otherwise interfere with the Game's executable code or allocated memory</li>
				<li>improve or alter your performance as a player in the Game ("cheating")</li>
				<li>block, subvert, deactivate, or otherwise interfere with the Game's protection and anti-cheating measures</li>
			</ul>
		<li>You may not reverse-engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Game or otherwise attempt to gain access to the source code for the Game.</li>
		<li>You may not alter,  disable, circumvent, or otherwise interfere with any revenue-generating mechanism used by the Game (including, but not limited to, advertisements and in-app purchases).</li>
		<li>By creating content in the Game (for example: choosing a callsign, customizing spacecraft, flying missions, or participating in competitions against other players), you automatically grant to InterAction studios a worldwide,   perpetual, non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable licence to use   that content (including to reproduce, distribute, modify,Â display and   perform it).</li>
		<li>The Game's native language is English. For your convenience, translations into other languages may also be available. Wherever there is conflict between the meaning or interpretation of English text and translated text, the native English text will prevail.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Breach of these Terms of Service may result in your current Game account being <strong>blocked</strong> or <strong>deleted</strong>, including any accounts used in the past and any accounts that you might create in the future. Blocking or deletion are irrevocable actions, and it is not possible to appeal the decision.</p>
